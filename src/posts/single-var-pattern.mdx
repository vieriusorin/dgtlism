## Introduction

The Single Var Pattern is a JavaScript coding convention where multiple variables are declared using a single `var`, `let`, or `const` statement, with each variable declaration separated by commas. This pattern promotes cleaner code organization and helps prevent hoisting-related bugs.

```javascript
const 
  firstName = "John",
  lastName = "Doe",
  age = 30
```
<div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>

## When to use

This pattern is useful when we want to declare multiple variables in a single line.
